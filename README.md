# AI Trading Entry Point Prediction Project

This project implements an AI model for determining optimal trading entry points with supporting rationale. The model uses machine learning to identify potential trading opportunities and provides clear explanations for its recommendations.

## Features

- **Data Preparation**: Load, preprocess, and feature engineering for trading data
- **Advanced Feature Engineering**: Technical indicators, price patterns, volatility metrics
- **Model Training**: Random Forest model with trained weights
- **Backtesting**: Test the model against historical data
- **Visualization**: Interactive charts and dashboards
- **Explainability**: Natural language explanations for trading signals

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Required packages in `requirements.txt`

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd trading
```

2. Create a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Interactive Notebooks

The easiest way to explore the project is through the Jupyter notebooks:

```bash
jupyter notebook notebooks/
```

The notebooks are organized in sequence:
1. Data exploration
2. Feature engineering
3. Model training
4. Backtesting
5. Visualization

### Command Line Interface

You can also run the model from the command line:

```bash
python src/main.py --data_file USATECH.IDXUSD_Candlestick_15_M_BID_01.01.2023-18.01.2025.csv
```

Optional arguments:
- `--confidence_threshold`: Minimum confidence for entry points (default: 0.6)
- `--profit_target`: Target profit percentage (default: 0.01)
- `--stop_loss`: Stop loss percentage (default: 0.005)
- `--future_periods`: Periods to look ahead for target (default: 10)

For more options:
```bash
python src/main.py --help
```

## Data Sources

The project uses USATECH index candlestick data:
- 15-minute timeframe: `USATECH.IDXUSD_Candlestick_15_M_BID_01.01.2023-18.01.2025.csv`
- 5-minute timeframe: `USATECH.IDXUSD_Candlestick_5_M_BID_01.01.2023-18.01.2025.csv`

## Model Approach

Our entry point prediction model uses a Random Forest classifier trained on historical price data with various technical indicators. The model looks for patterns that precede profitable trade opportunities based on a defined risk-reward ratio.

Key features include:
- Moving averages (SMA, EMA)
- Oscillators (RSI, MACD)
- Volatility measures (Bollinger Bands, ATR)
- Price patterns and crossover signals
- Volume indicators

## Results and Visualization

The model generates several visualizations to help understand its predictions:
- Price charts with entry points
- Technical indicator dashboards
- Trade result analysis
- Performance metrics
- Feature importance analysis

Results are saved in the `results/` directory with timestamped folders for each run.

## Customization

The model is designed to be flexible and can be customized in several ways:
- Change the target asset by providing different data files
- Adjust profit target and stop loss parameters
- Modify the feature engineering process
- Implement different model architectures
